For this assignment, I changed the implementation of Norm(), InnerProduct(), and Copy() to use the mkl library.
I timed the executions of the entire ConjugateGradients algorithm and compare the result with LaplaceSolver_1_5 (with DO_NOT_USE_MKL flag).

I ran both versions 5 times and calculated their averages. We can see that the
modified version is slightly faster than the unmodified version by ~700ms. Below
are the results:
